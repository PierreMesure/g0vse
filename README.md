# g0vse

g0vse is a project aiming to make the information available on the Swedish government's website ([regeringen.se](https://www.regeringen.se) more accessible.

For now, it just fetches the complete list of pages on the website using the private API and converts that list into JSON.

## Why g0vse

The name is a reference and an homage to the g0v movement in Taiwan, where activists were replicating government websites to increase transparency and usability and hosting the g0v.tw domain, making it easy to go from the official website (at gov.tw) to the grassroot alternative.
